          <h2>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h2>
          <p>We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>

              <h3>part-time consultants</h3>
              <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</p>

              <h3>remote consultants</h3>
              <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
          </article>

          <div class="firstpara">
            <article class="centrealignpara">
              <h3>short-term contracts</h3>
              <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.</p>
