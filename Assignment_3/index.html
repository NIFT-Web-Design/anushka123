            <p>The Tribal women were tattoo lovers centuries before the modern world found something fashionable in it. They use all herbal materials for their tattooing. The methods they use for tattooing are very eco-friendly and therapeutic (safe method - handpoking). They make the kajal which is used to first draw the design , from erandi ka tel (caster oil) which a completely natural product. Then after they make the design on the skin , they make the permanent tattoo by handpoking using a needle which is completely sanitized and hygienic. They use one needle to do 3 TATTOOS. After that needle is used they throw it away. It might take hours to finish one design. That is how it's all done.</p>
